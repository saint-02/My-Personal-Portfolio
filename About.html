				<h3>My Journey</h3>
				<p>My journey into web development began with desire to building something from scratch which would become a technical problem-solving piece of software. I started by learning the basics on my own and grew through online courses, experimenting with small projects, and challenging my self to solve real problems. Over time, I built a file viewer/downloader tool, a forex currency prediction app, and several websites that strengthened my understanding of frontend and backend development. Every project pushes me to learn more and become better.</p>

This includes responsive websites, interactive Javascript features, backend logic with node.js, and UI layouts that work smoothly on both mobile and desktop. I enjoy working through challenges, fixing bugs and building features that improve user experience.</p>
